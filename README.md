## Project Proposal: A Reconfigurable ALU for Approximate Computing

### 1\. Introduction

This project proposes the design and implementation of a reconfigurable Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing calculations with varying levels of precision. The ALU will be integrated into the **Microwatt** softcore, a minimal, dual-issue, in-order PowerPC ISA. The primary goal is to demonstrate the principles of **approximate computing** by enabling the ALU to switch between four distinct modes of operation: exact, approximate, moderately approximate, and very approximate. This will allow for dynamic trade-offs between computational accuracy, performance, and power consumption.

### 2\. Problem Statement

Modern computing, especially in areas like machine learning, signal processing, and computer graphics, often involves computations where some loss of precision is acceptable. Traditional ALUs are designed for maximum accuracy, which can be computationally expensive and power-intensive. By developing an ALU with selectable precision, we can address this inefficiency, providing a more versatile and energy-efficient solution for applications that can tolerate a degree of error. This project seeks to build a functional prototype that proves the viability and benefits of this approach.

### 3\. Proposed Solution

The solution involves a multi-pronged approach:

  * **Hardware Design:** The core of the project is the design of the reconfigurable ALU in a Hardware Description Language (HDL), likely Verilog. The design will include logic for standard operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) but will also incorporate dedicated circuitry to perform the various levels of approximation. Control signals will be used to select the desired mode of operation.

  * **Microwatt Integration:** The newly designed ALU will replace the standard ALU within the Microwatt softcore. This integration will involve modifying the Microwatt's datapath and control unit to interface with the reconfigurable ALU and its control signals.

  * **Approximation Techniques:** Different approximation techniques will be explored and implemented for various arithmetic operations. For example, approximate adders could be implemented using techniques like truncated adders, where less significant bits are simply ignored, or error-tolerant adders that use simplified carry propagation. Similarly, approximate multipliers could use truncated Booth's algorithm or simplified partial product summation.

  * **Validation and Analysis:** The project will include a comprehensive verification plan. Testbenches will be developed to validate the functionality of each precision mode. We will measure and analyze key performance metrics such as power consumption, latency (performance), and error rate for each mode to quantify the trade-offs.

### 4\. Expected Outcomes

  * A functional, open-source GitHub repository containing the Verilog source code for a reconfigurable ALU.
  * Demonstration of the ALU's integration into the Microwatt PowerPC softcore.
  * Quantitative analysis of the power, performance, and accuracy trade-offs for each of the four precision modes.
  * A clear and well-documented project that serves as a valuable resource for students and researchers in hardware design and approximate computing.
  * A working example that showcases the practical application of approximate computing principles at the hardware level.
